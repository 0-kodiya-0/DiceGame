Can I use third-party libraries?

No, you are only allowed to use the standard library.



Can I show you my code and ask if it is correct? Can you help me with the coursework code?

No. This is assessed work. The lectures and tutorials are designed to build your knowledge so that you can complete the coursework independently.



Can you explain a specific part of the coursework?

Yes, clarifications will be provided, but only after you have thoroughly read the coursework specification. A coursework discussion was also conducted during the lecture, and any points covered in that session will not be further clarified.

The last date for seeking clarifications is 19th March 2025 (one week before the submission deadline).



The specification does not mention how to approach or implement X or Y. What should I do?

If a particular implementation detail is not specified, you are free to follow your own approach, provided that you use only the classes available in the standard Android library and official support libraries.

Any assumptions you make that are already addressed in the coursework specification will not be considered valid.



Can I use Java instead of Kotlin? Why not?

No. This module focuses on Kotlin, not Java.



Can I use an IDE other than Android Studio? Why not?

No. The coursework must be completed using Android Studio, as per the module requirements.



Should I handle screen rotation (landscape mode)?

Yes. The application should retain and display the same information after a configuration change (e.g., screen rotation).



Can I use ViewModel for the coursework?

No. You are expected to work within the scope of the module. The content covered in Weeks 1â€“6 provides the necessary theoretical background and practical experience for implementing the coursework.

Components outside this scope, such as ViewModel, NavHost/NavController, LiveData, etc., are not allowed. Implementing them will be discouraged during the viva.
